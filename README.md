Github Github-Tutorial

The purpose of this project is to show how Git and Github works. This project will be made up of knowledge based articles that I have created to demonstrate how to use Git and Git hub. This project will be a great reference for anyone who wants to learn how to store their projects on Git hub or refresh their memory if it has been awhile since the last time they used Github or Git in the terminal.
