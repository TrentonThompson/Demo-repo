Github Github-Tutorial

The purpose of this project is to show how Git and Github works. This project will be made up of a knowledge based article I have created called How to use Github. This will help a user to create an account on Github, Install Git, Install Visual Studio Code, Connect to repository in Visual Studio Code editor and make changes. This project will be a great reference for anyone who wants to learn how to store their projects on Git hub or refresh their memory if it has been awhile since the last time they used Github or Git in the terminal.
